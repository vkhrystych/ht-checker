# deel-frontend-test

## How to run

This project was bootstrapped with `create-react-app`.

```
npm install
# dev
npm start
# prod
npm build
# tests
npm test
```

## Notes

I left a couple of TODO's. Also, due to time constraint, the styling doesn't look perfect.
If I were to invest more time in that task, I would:

- improve design (e.g by adding search and clear icon)
- add positioning library for results list
- improve results list accessibility
- fix TODO's
